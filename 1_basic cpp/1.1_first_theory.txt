if there is no main() function 

error 
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/13/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/Scrt1.o: in function `_start':
(.text+0x1b): undefined reference to `main'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status


if instead of main we writre main1()  same error 


in single cpp file , whic h we are goi9nfg t ocompile , ther eshould be exactly one main() function

we can also define diffrent main1 , main2 etc function , but we should have ,main() in file 


even iostream nahi bhi hoga toh cha;lega , 


because iostream is for in put out 



let we want to add 2 number and save them in a file , then , no need of input and output , we need to include header files , containg file operation 



overall , there should be a main function , it can be empty , no issue
