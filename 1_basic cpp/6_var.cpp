/*
var 


var are wrapper 
basically these are names that points to some memory location in ram and in that memeory location , some data is stored 

to access that darta or change the data , we need some reference 
for that referencing ,var are used 


var are just name for some sopecific part of memeory 


*/



/*
working 


var name points to first memeoey address 

and how many bits or bytes is decided by datatype 


eg int is of 8 bytes 

let say a var adarsh is pointing to memeoey address 1000
adars his of int data type ===> 8 byte===> 64 bit 
1000 to 1063 

whwn we want to save any data in adarsh 

first it converts that data in to binary == >then in 64 bits => then save it from 1000 to 1063 


, when we access data of adarsh , it will go to 1000 address  and start reading upto 1063 , the nconvert to decimal and returns data to us 



let say we have created a int var of size 2 byte , and we aresaving data of 4 byte then overflow will occour 


go and check in notes
